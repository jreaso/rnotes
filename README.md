# Personal R Notes

These are personal notes on R mainly for reference, written over the course of two modules taken at university,

- MLLN (Machine Learning and Neural Networks) (2022-23)
- DSSC (Data Science and Statistical Computing) (2021-22)

Although this current version is more focused on the content for the MLLN module.

These are heavily based off the notes of the respective courses (see links below) and I do not take any credit for the contents of these notes. There may still be mistakes and inaccuracies from myself.
